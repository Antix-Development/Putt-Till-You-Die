<br>

Putt Till You Die is my first submission for the 2022 [js13kGames](https://js13kgames.com) competition, where over a one month period you create a game based on a theme (death for 2022) and then you cram your entire game (code and assets) into a 13Kb zip file and submit it.

You can play Putt Till You Die on [its js13k competition page](https://js13kgames.com/entries/), or download and load index.html from this repository in your web browser.

## Introduction

Putt Till You Die is a 2 dimensional bird's eye view mini-putt golf game written in JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

The game its self doesn't really fit in with the theme but hey, you could literally die whilst playing the game.. as you could any other game ;)

Also during the production of this game, my dear friend *Ewook* passed away after a short battle with cancer. He loved golf and up until a month before his passing was playing 4 rounds a week. He was 84 and this game is dedicated to him.

## Gameplay

The aim of Putt Till You Die is to basically putt the ball into the goal. That's prety much it.

Putt Till You Die is fairly easy to operate..
- Hold and move the left mouse button to aim, a longer line means more putt power.
- Press space key to cancel aiming.
- Release the left mouse button to make your putt.
- Hold the shift key to show your statistics.

Putt Till You Die is best enjoyed in fullscreen and with some chillout music playing in the background.

Note that when you close the Putt Till You Die application, the game state will be persisted to the browsers local storage, so the next time you start Putt Till You Die, the game will continue exactly in the same state.

## Features

- Unlimited procedural generated holes!
- High resolution graphics.
- Seeded PRNG (Pseudo Random Number Generator) so the game is the same across devices.
- A persistent game state.

Particle imagery was created using [GIMP](https://gimp.org/), and all other imagery is programatically generated.

Sound effects were created using Frank Force's fantastic [ZzFX](https://killedbyapixel.github.io/ZzFX/).

[Base64 Image](https://www.base64-image.de) was used to convert the PNG particle image to an embeddable data URI.

[Terser](https://terser.org/) was used to minify the JavaScript code.

## The Code

[Mini Physics](https://github.com/xem/mini2Dphysics) by Xem us used for the physics simulation. It has a small issue where if a circle collides with two axis aligned boxes that are directly adjacent to eachother, the collision does not work correctly. If I had more time I'd just write my own code but time does not allow :(

I'm always more than happy to answer any questions you might have regarding the code, just drop me a line at antix.development@gmail.com :)
