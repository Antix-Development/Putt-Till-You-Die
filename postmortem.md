# Putt Till You Die Postmortem

Whilst studying to attain my Bachelor Of Computing Science degree I wrote some JavaScript code to procedurally generate closed paths. Since then I've wanted to use it to incorporate it into a js13k submission.

After brainstorming I decided to use the code to generate mini-putt golf holes because I'm familiar with what is involved in creatng a mini-putt game, I could finally use the amazing Mini-Physics code by Xem in something, and I felt that I could complete the game in about 2 weeks, a good timeframe because I also wanted to create three submissions for the 2022 js13k competition.
